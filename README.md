##About

Devise Brewers & Beers is an example application built on the [Devise](http://github.com/devisephp/cms) content management system. It showcases the three major application structures of Devise:

1. Easy to implement and use front-end editing on a non-model content areas using html attributes. This is showcased throughout the homepage section of the site. My mom was able to make this content manageable... while drinking beers.

2. Dead-simple model editing is showcased on the brewer side of the application. Brewers has a model and a database table but you are able to utilize the Devise editor to edit your models.

3. On the Beers site we recreate a 'CRUD' type scenario that shows how you can connect the front-end to your custom classes and execute custom code.
